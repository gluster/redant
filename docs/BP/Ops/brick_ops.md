# Brick Ops:

The code can be found at [brick_ops.py](../../../common/ops/gluster_ops/brick_ops.py)

1) **add_brick**<br>
		This method is used to add a brick or a set of bricks to the volume.

			2. brick_str (list): String of brick cmd created by form_brick_cmd function.
			3. node (str): The node on which the command is to be run.
			4. force (bool): If set to True will add force in the command being executed.
			5. replica count (int): Optional parameter with default value of None.
			6. arbiter_count (int): Optional parameter with default value of None.
		Returns:
			A dictionary consisting                                        
            1. Flag : Flag to check if connection failed
