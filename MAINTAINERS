Redant Maintainers
=====================

The intention of this file is not to establish who owns what parts of the
code base, but to provide a set of names that developers can consult when they
have a question about a particular subset and also to provide a set of names
to be CC'd when submitting a patch to obtain appropriate review.

In general, if you have a question about inclusion of a patch, you should
consult gluster-devel@gluster.org and not any specific individual privately.

Descriptions of section entries:

	M: Main contact that knows and takes care of this area
	L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area
	W: Web-page with status/info
	S: Status, one of the following:
	   Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	   Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	   Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below.
	   Orphan:	No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
			role as you write your new code].
	   Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
    P: Peer for a component
